## üì• Download

You can download the **all-in-one ZIP package** (contains the compiled executable, `yt-dlp.exe`, and `ffmpeg` binaries) from our Release page:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k96JVCJwOjr-2_PjdT3hxuZkTfkTrtkU/

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The ZIP is ‚âà400‚ÄØMB because it includes FFmpeg and yt-dlp for broader use beyond this CLI.

Alternatively, if you prefer to use your own Python environment, you can download just the **`music_downloader.py`** script from the main branch and follow the Python setup below.
